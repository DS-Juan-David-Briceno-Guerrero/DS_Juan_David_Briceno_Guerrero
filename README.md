- ðŸŒ± Within this repository I'm going to be posting cases of study applying data science approaches to resolve diverse contexts issues.

  - We will discover some methods for classification and regression in supervised and unsupervised ML tasks.
  - For each model-case I'll aim to expose the best practices and a tuning approach to improve its results.

I hope you will enjoy it!
