- ðŸŒ± Within this repository I'm going to be posting cases of study to apply Machine Learning with a variety of different models.
  - We will discover some methods for classification for supervised and unsupervised ML taskes.
  - For each model-case I'll aim to expose the best practices and a tuning to improve the results.

I hope you will enjoy it!
